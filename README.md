# DeepMarianaTrench
Neural networks built w/ Tensorflow 2.X that create psychedelic/abstract art. Inspired by Google DeepDream (https://ai.googleblog.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html)

Above is the progression of an input pictures transformation

Above is the differences in output images. They all have the same input image

For more information on the project please read DMTPaper.pdf

Plans for the future : Make a transfer learning model with InceptionV3 but give same label to different classes to see what output is created. Ex. Dog and Cars are now "0" instead of Dogs : 0, Car : 1.

The following notebook is very useful in understanding DeepDream and DeepMarianaTrench (https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/generative/deepdream.ipynb)
